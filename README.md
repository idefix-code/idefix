Download:
---------

using either ssh or https url as `<address>`
```shell
git clone <address> idefix
cd idefix
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Installation:
-------------

Set the `IDEFIX_DIR` environment variable to the absolute path of the directory

```shell
export IDEFIX_DIR=<idefix main folder>
```

Add this line to `~/.<shell_rc_file>` for a permanent install.


Compile an example:
-------------------
Go to the example directory.
For instance:

```shell
cd test/HD/sod
```

Configure the code launching cmake (version >= 3.16) in the example directory:

```shell
cmake $IDEFIX_DIR
```

Several options can be enabled from the command line (a complete list is available with `cmake $IDEFIX_DIR -LH`). For instance: `-DIdefix_RECONSTRUCTION=Parabolic` (enable PPM reconstruction), `-DIdefix_MPI=ON` (enable mpi), `-DKokkos_ENABLE_OPENMP=ON` (enable openmp parallelisation), etc... For more complex target architectures, it is recommended to use cmake GUI launching `ccmake $IDEFIX_DIR` in place of `cmake` and then switching on the required options.

One can then compile the code:

```shell
make -j8
```

Running
-------------------
### serial (gpu/cpu), openMP (cpu)
simple launch the executable

```shell
./idefix
```

### With MPI (cpu)
`-dec` can be used to specify a domain decomposition manually.

It can be omitted for 1D problems, or if `NX`, `NY`, `NZ` and `nproc` are **all** powers of 2.
Otherwise, `-dec` is mandatory. For instance, in 2D, using a 2x2 domain decomposition:

```shell
mpirun -np 4 ./idefix -dec 2 2
```

or in 3D, using a 1x2x4 decomposition:

```shell
mpirun -np 8 ./idefix -dec 1 2 4
```

### With MPI (gpu)
The same rules for cpu domain decomposition applies for gpus. In addition, one should manually specify how many GPU devices one wants to use **per node**. Example, in a run with 2 nodes, 4 gpu per node, one would launch idefix with

```shell
mpirun -np 8 ./idefix -dec 1 2 4 --kokkos-num-devices=4
```

Profiling
-------------------
use the kokkos profiler tool, which can be downloaded from kokkos-tools (on github)
Then set the environement variable:

```shell
export KOKKOS_PROFILE_LIBRARY=kokkos-tools/src/tools/space-time-stack/kp_space_time_stack.so
````

and then simply run the code (no need to recompile)

Debugging
-------------------
Add `-DIdefix_DEBUG=ON` when calling cmake, or activate the `Idefix_DEBUG` option in ccmake, and recompile.
Note that this option triggers a lot of outputs and memory access checks which significantly slow down the code.

Running tests
-------------------
Tests require Python 3 along with some third party dependencies to be installed.
To install those deps, run
```shell
pip install -r test/python_requirements.txt
```

The test suite itself is then run with
```shell
bash test/checks.sh
```

Contributing
-------------------
Idefix is developed with the help of the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) framework.
We use [cpplint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cpplint) to validate code style, mostly
following the Google standards for C++, and several pre-commit hooks to automatically fix
some coding bad practices.

It is recommended (though not mandatory) to install pre-commit by running the following
script from the top level of the repo
```shell
python3 -m pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Then, as one checks in their contribution with `git commit`, pre-commit hooks may perform
changes in situ. One then needs to re-add and enter the `git commit` command again for the
commit to be validated.
Note that an important hook that does _not_ perform auto-fixes is `cpplint`, so contributors
need to accomodate for this one by hand.

> Note that if for any reason you do not wish, or are unable to install pre-commit in your
> environment, formatting errors will be caught by our CI after you open a merge-request.
