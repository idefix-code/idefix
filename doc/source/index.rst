=================
About *Idefix*
=================
*Idefix* is designed to be a performance-portable astrophysical code. This means that it can run both on your laptop's cpu or on the largest GPU HPCs recently
bought by your university. More technically, *Idefix* can run in serial, use OpenMP and/or MPI (message passing interface) for parallelization, and use CUDA or Xeon-Phi for
out of chip acceleration. Of course, all these capabilities are embedded within one single code, so the code relies on relatively abstracted classes and objects available in C++17, which are not necessarily
familiar to astrophysicists. A large effort has been devoted to simplify this level of abstraction so that the code can be modified by researchers and students familiar with C and who are aware of basic object-oriented concepts.

In order to ease the transition from more common codes, *Idefix* has been designed to be close to the PLUTO code. Several of the data structures have identical names, input files are very similar and the numerical integration
algorithm is essentially the same (but with some major modification to its structure). Hence, your favourite PLUTO setup can be converted into an *Idefix* setup within a couple of hours.

================
Requirements
================
*Idefix* is written is standard C++17 and does not rely on any external library in serial (non MPI).

Compiler
  *Idefix* requires a C++17 compatible compiler. It has been tested successfully with GCC (>8), Intel compiler suite (>2018) and
  Clang on both Intel and AMD CPUs. *Idefix* has also been tested on NVIDIA GPUs (Pascal, Volta and Ampere architectures) using the nvcc (>10) compiler, and on AMD GPUs (Radeon Mi50, Mi210, Mi250) using the hipcc compiler.

Kokkos library
  *Idefix* relies internally on the `Kokkos <https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos>`_ library, which is bundled with *Idefix* as a git submodule and compiled on the fly, hence no external installation is required.

MPI library
  When using MPI parallelisation, *Idefix* relies on an external MPI library. *Idefix* has been tested successfully with OpenMPI and IntelMPI libraries. When used on GPU architectures, *Idefix* assumes that
  the MPI library is GPU-Aware. If unsure, check this last point with your system administrator.
