Kokkos
=====================

*Idefix* comes with the `Kokkos <https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos>`_ library bundled as a git submodule. The bundled version of the Kokkos
library is known to work for the version of Idefix associated to it, and is compiled on the fly when
compiling Idefix. Hence, there is no need to download or compile separately Kokkos.

For technical details on Kokkos, advanced users are encouraged to read the `Kokkos documentation <https://kokkos.github.io/kokkos-core-wiki/>`_ and watch the
`Kokkos lecture notes <https://kokkos.github.io/kokkos-core-wiki/videolectures.html>`_.
